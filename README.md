# ChatBot
A little chatbot.

If a sentence contains: 
- "how are you", "how r u", "how r you", "how are u", "how're you", "how're u"
- "what are you doing", "what r u doing", "what r u doin", "what are u doing", "what r you doing", "what are you doin", "what r you doin", "what are u doin", "what're you doing", "what're u doing", "what're u doin", "what're you doin"
- "lol", "lool", "haha", "lel", "lul", "hehe"
- "what time is it", "what is the time", "what's the time"
- "exit", "goodbye", "ciao", "bye", "im out", "i'm out"
- "thank you", "ty", "thanks", "thx"
- "tell me a joke"
- "how old are you", "when were you born", "what is your age", "what's your age"
- "nice", "okay", "that was funny", "cool", "wow", "that is good", "that's good", "thats good"
- "tell me wise words", "wise words", "what is wise", "do you have an advise", "advise", "wisdom", "if i had wisdom"

Or the sentence is equal to:
- "why?", "why why why?"

The bot gets triggered.

After a command:
- "timer hh:mm:ss" a timer is set. hh stands for hours, mm for minutes, ss for seconds. For example "timer 00:00:10" will ring after 10 seconds
- "google search string" opens the default browser and searches for the following string -> in this case it would google for "search string"
